## Masters in Artificial Intelligence

### **CS5180:** Reinforcement Learning

Introduces reinforcement learning and the underlying computational frameworks and
the Markov decision process framework. Covers a variety of reinforcement learning
algorithms, including model-based, model-free, value function, policy gradient,
actor-critic, and Monte Carlo methods. Examines commonly used representations
including deep learning representations and approaches to partially observable
problems. Students are expected to have a working knowledge of probability and linear
algebra, to complete programming assignments, and to complete a course project that
applies some form of reinforcement learning to a problem of interest.

### **CS5100:** Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

Introduces the fundamental problems, theories, and algorithms of the artificial
intelligence field. Topics include heuristic search and game trees, knowledge
representation using predicate calculus, automated deduction and its applications,
problem solving and planning, and introduction to machine learning. Required course
work includes the creation of working programs that solve problems, reason logically,
and/or improve their own performance using techniques presented in the course. Requires
experience in Java programming.

### **CS5340:** Human-Computer Interaction

Covers the principles of human-computer interaction and the design and evaluation of
user interfaces. Topics include an overview of human information processing subsystems
(perception, memory, attention, and problem solving); how the properties of these
systems affect the design of user interfaces; the principles, guidelines, and
specification languages for designing good user interfaces, with emphasis on tool kits
and libraries of standard graphical user interface objects; and a variety of interface
evaluation methodologies that can be used to measure the usability of software. Other
topics may include World Wide Web design principles and tools, computer-supported
cooperative work, multimodal and “next generation” interfaces, speech and natural
language interfaces, and virtual reality interfaces. Course work includes both the
creation and implementation of original user interface designs, and the evaluation of
user interfaces created by others. Requires knowledge of C programming language/UNIX.

### **CS5800:** Algorithms

Presents the mathematical techniques used for the design and analysis of computer
algorithms. Focuses on algorithmic design paradigms and techniques for analyzing
the correctness, time, and space complexity of algorithms. Topics may include
asymptotic notation, recurrences, loop invariants, Hoare triples, sorting and
searching, advanced data structures, lower bounds, hashing, greedy algorithms,
dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and NP-completeness.

### **CS6120:** Natural Language Processing

Provides an introduction to the computational modeling of human language, the ongoing
effort to create computer programs that can communicate with people in natural language,
and current applications of the natural language field, such as automated document
classification, intelligent query processing, and information extraction. Topics include
computational models of grammar and automatic parsing, statistical language models and
corpora understand language, models of discourse structure, and language use by intelligent
agents. Course work includes formal and mathematical analysis of language models, and
implementation of working programs that analyze and interpret natural language text.

### **CS6140:** Machine Learning

Provides a broad look at a variety of techniques used in machine learning and data
mining, and also examines issues associated with their use. Topics include algorithms
for supervised learning including decision tree induction, artificial neural networks,
instance-based learning, probabilistic methods, and support vector machines;
unsupervised learning; and reinforcement learning. Also covers computational learning
theory and other methods for analyzing and measuring the performance of learning
algorithms. Course work includes a programming term project.

### **CS6200:** Information Retrieval

Provides an introduction to information retrieval systems and different approaches to
information retrieval. Topics covered include evaluation of information retrieval
systems; retrieval, language, and indexing models; file organization; compression;
relevance feedback; clustering; distributed retrieval and meta-search; probabilistic
approaches to information retrieval; Web retrieval; filtering, collaborative filtering,
and recommendation systems; cross-language IR; multimedia IR; and machine learning for
information retrieval.

### **MATH7233:** Graph Theory

Covers fundamental concepts in graph theory. Topics include adjacency and incidence
matrices, paths and connectedness, and vertex degrees and counting; trees and distance
including properties of trees, distance in graphs, spanning trees, minimum spanning
trees, and shortest paths; matchings and factors including matchings in bipartite
graphs, Hall&'s matching condition, and min-max theorems; connectivity, such as
vertex connectivity, edge connectivity, k-connected graphs, and Menger's theorem;
network flows including maximum network flow, and integral flows; vertex colorings,
such as upper bounds, Brooks, theorem, graphs with large chromatic number, and critical
graphs; Eulerian circuits and Hamiltonian cycles including Euler's theorem, necessary
conditions for Hamiltonian cycles, and sufficient conditions; planar graphs including
embeddings and Euler's formula, characterization of planar graphs (Kuratowski's theorem);
and Ramsey theory including Ramsey's theorem, Ramsey numbers, and graph Ramsey theory.
