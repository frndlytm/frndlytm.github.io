# About Me

> "[T]he past is no longer, the future is not yet, and as for the instantaneous present,
> everyone knows it is not at all: it is the limit of infinite division, like the
> dimensionless point." - Jean Paul Satre, Being and Nothingness


Attacking difficult problems with innovative solutions has always energized me. I am a
driven, talented, and creative man with an analytical mind capable of extremely abstract
thinking.

I have always loved thinking for the sake of it, and oftentimes I will escape to
meditation where I imagine what technology would be required to reshape thoughts or help
the blind see.

## Early Life and Education

In high school, I discovered a passion for philosophy, and in college, I realized math
was the ideal field to apply my skills and passion. After all, it's basically the
philosophy of representing things as numbers.

During my undergraduate degree at Northeastern University, I pursued a Co-op in
Actuarial Planning for Personal Insurance at Liberty Mutual. During this experience,
I learned that I was pursuing the actuarial career path for the wrong reasons, and I
experienced my first taste of Knowledge Management for Data Discovery as I built a data
dictionary for the Personal Insurance Planning Team.

## Career

Since then, I've focused my energy on data science and language processing on top of
database metadata. This began at Granite where I created a model migration tool, and
continued at Wayfair where I have indexed numerous forms of dataset and microservice
metadata from a variety of live and static observability data streams into
ElasticSearch, BigQuery, and Neo4j to enhance the discovery experience for Business
Intelligence, Data Science, and Software Engineering use cases.

Now, I'm working towards a career in Natural Language Processing by finishing my
Masters in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University. I hope by studying the
broadly applicable field of AI that someday I will be equipped to change the world for
the better, specifically by improving access to information and increasing understanding
of the growing complexities of our world through Knowledge Representation Learning.

## Looking Forward

I believe that by creating spaces for open, equitable, data-driven collaboration,
humanity can right itself for many generations to come.
